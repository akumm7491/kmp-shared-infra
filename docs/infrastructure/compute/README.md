# Compute Infrastructure

This document outlines the compute infrastructure components and configurations used in the KMP Shared Infrastructure project.

## Overview

Our compute infrastructure is designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure, providing the foundation for running microservices and applications in a Kubernetes environment.

## Components

### 1. Kubernetes Clusters

#### Production Cluster
- High-availability setup with multiple control plane nodes
- Node auto-scaling configuration
- Multi-zone deployment for resilience
- Dedicated node pools for different workload types

#### Development/Staging Cluster
- Smaller footprint for cost optimization
- Shared resources for development workloads
- Configured for rapid deployment and testing

### 2. Node Types and Sizing

#### Application Nodes
- Standard nodes for general workloads
- Resource limits: 
  - CPU: 4-8 cores
  - Memory: 16-32GB RAM
  - Storage: 100GB SSD

#### Database Nodes
- Optimized for database workloads
- Resource specifications:
  - CPU: 8-16 cores
  - Memory: 32-64GB RAM
  - Storage: 500GB-1TB SSD

#### Utility Nodes
- For monitoring, logging, and other support services
- Resource specifications:
  - CPU: 2-4 cores
  - Memory: 8-16GB RAM
  - Storage: 100GB SSD

### 3. Auto-scaling Configuration

#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
- CPU threshold: 70%
- Memory threshold: 80%
- Custom metrics support enabled
- Scaling limits:
  - Minimum replicas: 2
  - Maximum replicas: 10

#### Cluster Autoscaling
- Node scaling based on pod resource requests
- Scale-up threshold: 80% resource utilization
- Scale-down threshold: 40% resource utilization
- Cool-down period: 10 minutes

### 4. Resource Management

#### Resource Quotas
- CPU and memory limits per namespace
- Storage quotas for persistent volumes
- Maximum number of pods per namespace

#### Resource Requests and Limits
- Default resource requests and limits for pods
- Quality of Service (QoS) classes configuration
- Over-provisioning settings for development environments

## Security

### 1. Network Security
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- Service mesh integration
- External traffic routing and filtering

### 2. Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration
- Service accounts for applications
- Pod security policies

### 3. Secrets Management
- Integration with external secrets management systems
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Rotation policies for credentials

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Infrastructure Monitoring
- Node and cluster metrics collection
- Resource utilization tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Cost optimization insights

### 2. Logging Infrastructure
- Centralized logging setup
- Log retention policies
- Log forwarding configuration

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Strategy
- Cluster state backups
- Application data backups
- Backup retention policies

### 2. Recovery Procedures
- Cluster recovery process
- Data restoration procedures
- Service continuity plans

## Best Practices

### 1. Resource Management
