# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The KMP Shared Infrastructure platform is designed as a modular, scalable system that provides core infrastructure components while maintaining isolation between different projects and services.

            PubSub[Redis PubSub]
        end
        
        subgraph "Project A Namespace"
            ServiceA1[Service A1]
            ServiceA2[Service A2]
        end
        
        subgraph "Project B Namespace"
            ServiceB1[Service B1]
            ServiceB2[Service B2]
        end
    end
```

## Key Components

### 1. Resource Isolation
- Namespace-based isolation
- Resource quotas per project
- Network policies
- Role-based access control

### 2. Core Infrastructure
Each project gets isolated instances of:
- Databases (TimescaleDB, Neo4j, Redis)
- Message queues (Kafka topics)
- Cache layers
- Storage buckets

### 3. Common Libraries
Modular libraries that can be included as needed:
- Authentication/Authorization
- Storage access
- Message handling
- Monitoring integration

### 4. Development Tools
- Project templates
- Service generators
- Local development environment
- Testing frameworks

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Components are loosely coupled
- Services can choose which modules to use
- Easy to add new components
- Support for custom implementations

### 2. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of services
- Distributed data storage
- Message queue scaling
- Cache layer distribution

### 3. Maintainability
- Centralized configuration
- Automated deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Self-healing capabilities

### 4. Security
- Zero-trust network model
- Service-to-service authentication
- Encrypted communication
- Secrets management

## Component Integration

### Service Creation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Tool as Project Tool
    participant Infra as Infrastructure
    participant K8s as Kubernetes
    
    Dev->>Tool: Create new service
    Tool->>Tool: Generate service code
    Tool->>Infra: Request resources
    Infra->>K8s: Create namespace
    Infra->>K8s: Apply resource quotas
    Infra->>K8s: Deploy core services
    K8s-->>Dev: Service ready
```

### Service Communication
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SA as Service A
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant SB as Service B
    participant Queue as Message Queue
    
    SA->>Auth: Authenticate
    Auth-->>SA: Token
    SA->>SB: Request with token
    SB->>Auth: Validate token
    Auth-->>SB: Valid
    SB-->>SA: Response
    SA->>Queue: Publish event
    Queue-->>SB: Consume event
```

## Resource Management
